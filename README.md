## EasyText
### An exercise in gRPC

This is a simple project where I aim to learn the foundations of writing a gRPC API (with a machine learning implementation).

Running the RPC Server:
> cd easytext/texttype && python texttype.py

**Don't forget to install the dependencies through:**
> python -m pip install requirements.txt

Run:
> python test.py
To verify that the server is running.
